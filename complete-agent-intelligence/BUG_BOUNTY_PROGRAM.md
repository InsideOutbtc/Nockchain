- Smart contract vulnerabilities allowing fund drainage
- Private key extraction from custody systems
- Critical authentication bypass in institutional systems

**Reward Calculation:**
```typescript
interface CriticalVulnerability {
  baseReward: number;
  impactMultiplier: number;
  exploitabilityScore: number;
  uniquenessBonus: number;
}

function calculateCriticalReward(vuln: CriticalVulnerability): number {
  const baseAmount = 50000;
  const maxAmount = 100000;
  
  const reward = baseAmount * vuln.impactMultiplier * vuln.exploitabilityScore + vuln.uniquenessBonus;
  
  return Math.min(reward, maxAmount);
}
```

- Privilege escalation
- Denial of service attacks
- Transaction manipulation
- Bypass of security controls

**Examples:**
- DEX integration vulnerabilities allowing price manipulation
